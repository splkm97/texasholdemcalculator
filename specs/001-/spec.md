# Feature Specification: Texas Hold'em Poker Hand Probability Calculator

**Feature Branch**: `001-`  
**Created**: 2025-09-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "텍사스 홀덤룰 기반으로 프리플랍, 플랍, 리버, 턴 단계에서 최종적으로 각 포커 핸드가 만들어지는 확률을 계산하여 화면상으로 표출하고 싶어"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → User wants Texas Hold'em probability calculator with stage-by-stage calculations
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: poker players, calculator system
   → Actions: calculate probabilities, display results
   → Data: poker hands, cards, probabilities
   → Constraints: Texas Hold'em rules, four game stages
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How many players should be considered in calculations?]
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should calculations include opponent modeling or just raw hand probabilities?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Primary flow: input hand cards, see probabilities at each stage
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (poker hands, cards, game stages, probabilities)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → Spec has some uncertainties marked for clarification
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A poker player wants to understand their winning chances at different stages of a Texas Hold'em hand. They input their hole cards and see probability calculations for making different poker hands as community cards are revealed through pre-flop, flop, turn, and river stages.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has two hole cards, **When** they start a new calculation, **Then** they see pre-flop probabilities for all possible poker hands
2. **Given** the flop cards are revealed, **When** the calculation updates, **Then** they see updated probabilities based on the 5 known cards
3. **Given** the turn card is revealed, **When** the calculation updates, **Then** they see probabilities based on 6 known cards
4. **Given** the river card is revealed, **When** the final calculation occurs, **Then** they see the actual final hand achieved
5. **Given** any stage of the game, **When** viewing results, **Then** probabilities are displayed clearly for each poker hand type (pair, two pair, three of a kind, straight, flush, full house, four of a kind, straight flush, royal flush)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when impossible combinations are selected (e.g., same card twice)?
- How does system handle invalid card combinations?
- What if user wants to reset and start over mid-calculation?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to input their two hole cards
- **FR-002**: System MUST calculate and display pre-flop probabilities for all poker hand types
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to input flop cards (3 community cards) and update probability calculations
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to input turn card (4th community card) and update probability calculations
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to input river card (5th community card) and show final hand result
- **FR-006**: System MUST display probabilities for all standard poker hands: High Card, Pair, Two Pair, Three of a Kind, Straight, Flush, Full House, Four of a Kind, Straight Flush, Royal Flush
- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent selection of duplicate cards
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate all card inputs against standard 52-card deck
- **FR-009**: System MUST calculate probabilities based on remaining unknown cards at each stage
- **FR-010**: System MUST display results in a clear, readable format on screen
- **FR-011**: Users MUST be able to reset and start a new calculation at any time
- **FR-012**: System MUST follow standard Texas Hold'em rules for hand rankings and combinations

*Clarifications needed:*
- **FR-013**: System MUST calculate probabilities for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: single player analysis or multi-player scenarios with opponent modeling?]
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what specific user interface - web, mobile, desktop application?]
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: real-time calculation or batch calculation after each input?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Playing Card**: Represents individual cards with suit and rank, part of standard 52-card deck
- **Poker Hand**: Represents different types of poker hands with associated rankings and probability calculations
- **Game Stage**: Represents the four stages of Texas Hold'em (pre-flop, flop, turn, river) with different numbers of known cards
- **Probability Calculation**: Represents calculated odds for achieving each poker hand type at any given stage
- **Player Hand**: Represents the combination of hole cards and community cards available to calculate probabilities
